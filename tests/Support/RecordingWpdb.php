/**
 * A $wpdb that records what it was asked and answers what it was told to.
 *
 * <b>Local rather than wp-mocks' Doubles\FakeWpdb, for one reason.</b>
 * That class is final and extends nothing, and Freedom's repositories
 * type-hint the real `wpdb` — deliberately, since a repository handed
 * something that is not a database connection is a wiring fault worth
 * failing on. A stand-in therefore has to *be* a wpdb, which means
 * extending the minimal class the bootstrap declares. LifeLines keeps a
 * local double for a comparable reason.
 *
 * What it is for is asserting on the *SQL*, not on rows. The behaviour
 * that matters most in these repositories cannot be observed any other
 * way: `revoked_at IS NULL` is part of the lookup rather than a check a
 * caller makes afterwards, and the only place that fact is visible is the
 * statement itself.
